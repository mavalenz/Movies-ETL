# Movies-ETL

## Overview
Amazing Prime, the world's largest online retailor wants to run a *Hackathon* to help them gather ideas on creating an algorithm to predict which movies released will become popular. They have tasked Britta with creating a dataset for the hackathon and we are helping her to **Extract**, **Transform**, and **Load** the dataset into a SQL database for hackathon participants to use. To help Britta with the ETL process we will peform the following:

1. Extract the Wikipedia Movies JSON data into a list of dictionaries.
2. Extract the Kaggle data for movie ratings and pull them into dataframes.
3. Transform the data through data cleaning strategies to make it usable.
4. We will follow an iterative process to clean the data: **Inspect**, **Plan**, and **Execute**.
5. Create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables.
